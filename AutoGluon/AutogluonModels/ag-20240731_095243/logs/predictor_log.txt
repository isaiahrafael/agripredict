Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 1200s
AutoGluon will save models to 'autogloun-daily'

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': True,

train_data with frequency 'None' has been resampled to frequency 'D'.
Provided train_data has 6679 rows (NaN fraction=27.0%), 227 time series. Median time series length is 30 (min=19, max=31). 
	Removing 177 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 31 will be used for training.
	After filtering, train_data has 1550 rows (NaN fraction=26.4%), 50 time series. Median time series length is 31 (min=31, max=31). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
